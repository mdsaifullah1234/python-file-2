    "Answer = In Python, when creating a custom exception, it is essential to inherit from the base Exception class or one of its subclasses. This is because the Exception class is a part of Python's built-in exception hierarchy, and it provides several important features and benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency and Compatibility: Inheriting from the Exception class ensures that your custom exception is compatible with the existing exception handling mechanisms in Python. This means it can be caught and handled using standard try and except blocks just like built-in exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Exception Attributes and Methods: The Exception class comes with standard attributes and methods that are helpful for error handling. For example, it includes the __str__ method, which allows you to provide a custom error message when the exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception Hierarchy: Python's exception hierarchy allows for more specific exceptions to inherit from broader ones. This hierarchy enables you to catch exceptions at different levels of specificity, making it easier to handle various exceptional situations in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clarity and Convention: By inheriting from the Exception class, you follow a well-established convention in Python. Other developers who read your code will easily understand that your custom exception is meant to be used for error handling."

    "Use Multiple Except Blocks:\n",

    "Try to Handle Exceptions Locally:\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle exceptions as close to their occurrence as possible, rather than letting them propagate up the call stack.\n",
    "Use else for Clean-Up Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the else block to execute code that should run when no exceptions occur within the try block. For example, cleanup or finalization steps.\n",
    "Use finally for Cleanup:\n",

    "Use the finally block to ensure that cleanup code (e.g., closing files or resources) is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n",

    "Consider Custom Exceptions:\n",

    "Create custom exceptions when necessary to handle specific errors or exceptional conditions in your code. This improves code organization and readability.\n",
    "Reraise When Necessary:\n",
